# About me

## Intro

I am an active Computer Engineering student at the **Budapest University of
Technology and Economics**. I have always been interested in technology; I
started learning programming when I was only 12 years old. I frequently release
my projects as open-source software on GitHub and help others learn programming
as a teaching assistant at my university.

## Tech stack

I am pretty versatile and can work with a wide range of technologies depending
on the project's needs and constraints. Bellow is a small list of **my most
commonly used** technologies and tools:
