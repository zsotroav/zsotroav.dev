<h2 class="subtitle is-size-2 has-text-link">Intro</h2>

<p>
  I am an active Computer Engineering student at the
  <strong class="has-text-link">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</strong>. I have
  always been interested in technology; I started learning programming when I was only 12 years old.
  I frequently release my projects as open-source software on GitHub and help others learn
  programming as a teaching assistant at my university.

<p>
  I am pretty versatile and can work with a wide range of technologies depending on the project's
  needs and constraints. Bellow is a small list of
  <strong class="has-text-link">my most commonly used</strong> technologies and tools:
